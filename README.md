## Machine Learning Predicting faulty Dosing pump
##### Using data from Taarifa and the ```Tanzanian``` Ministry of ```water or oil``` , can you predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all? This is an intermediate-level practice competition. Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of dosing pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable ```water or oil``` is available to communities across  ```For example Tanzania.```
